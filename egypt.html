            <h2>EGYPT</h2><br><br><br>
            <p>Egypt is home to some of the world’s greatest ancient wonders, and beyond the big-ticket items such as the pyramids, there’s a plethora of unmissable attractions to see, from ancient Luxor to the modern Grand Aquarium. The Sphinx, the River Nile, the Pyramids of Giza. You don’t need to have been to Egypt to be aware of its pulling power. </p>

              <h2>1. The Temples of Karnak</h2>
              <p>Big, bold, and hugely ambitious, Luxor's mammoth Temple of Karnak complex is one of Ancient Egypt's grandest building projects. Every pharaoh worth their salt added and amended the buildings here during their reign, stamping their seal on the kingdom's most revered religious sanctuary. For Karnak was the house of the gods, and its glories were to be feted by all.</p>

              <h2>2. The Theban Necropolis</h2>
              <p>Across the Nile from Luxor, the Theban Necropolis testifies to the same obsession with death and resurrection that produced the Pyramids. Mindful of how these had failed to protect the mummies of the Old Kingdom pharaohs, later rulers opted for concealment, sinking their tombs in the arid Theban Hills while perpetuating their memory with gigantic mortuary temples on the plain below.</p>

              <p>After the Muslims conquered Egypt in 641 AD, they built their city, Al-Fustat, on what is now the southern border of modern Cairo. Today, this section of the city contains many important sites including the Mosque of Sultan Hassan, Mosque of al-Azhar and the Khan al-Khalili market, which is considered the heart of this area.</p>
