          <p>As the birthplace of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance, it's not surprising that Italy should be so rich in masterpieces of art and architecture, or that it should have more UNESCO World Heritage cultural sites than any other country in the world.</p>

            <h2>1. Colesseum</h2>
            <p>This huge amphitheater, the largest of its kind ever built by the Roman Empire and the largest of their constructions to survive, remained a model for sports facilities right up to modern times. Built by Vespasian in AD 72 and enlarged by the addition of a fourth story by his son, Titus, it was a venue for public spectacles and shows - even mock sea battles.</p>

            <h2>2. The Grand Canal in Venice</h2>
            <p>A gondola ride through the canals of Venice is a tradition that travelers have been enjoying for centuries. Venice is a city of islands, and the canals have long been the city's main streets, connected by a labyrinth of narrow passageways.<br><br>The Grand Canal is the largest and most famous of these waterways, cutting a wide S-shaped route through the city. Along its sides are the grandest of the palaces once owned by the wealthiest and most powerful families of the Venetian Republic. The best way to see many of the grand palaces, whose fronts face the water, is from a Vaporetto ride along the Grand Canal.</p>

          <p id="p">Dramatically poised at the top of a broad flight of stairs, the The Church of St. Ignatius of Loyola was built in the baroque style between 1699 and 1725. Inside, magnificent frescos display scenes from the life of St Ignatius, founder of the Society of Jesus. Abutting the church is the former Jesuit college Collegium Ragusinum, today the Diocesan Classical high sehool. </p>

            <p>"The Vatican, the Museum of Museums," not only houses the extensive collections of art, archaeology and ethno-anthropology gathered by the Popes over the centuries but also contains some of the Apostolic Palace's most extraordinary and artistically significant rooms. Any history of the museums' collections should rightly begin with the history of the rooms that the Popes over the ages chose as places of residenice or private prayer and refiection.</p>

            <p>The Pantheon, an exceptionally well preserved remnant from Roman times, reveals the incredible architectural achievements of the Roman Empire.<br><br>The precise proportions of the building, dedicated to the planetary gods, with the height equal to the diameter, and a single beam of light entering the room from the top of the dome, were intended to represent the firmament and the sun.<br><br>Disused after early Christian kings forbade use of a pagan temple as a church, it was later consecrated by the Pope in AD 609. Italian Kings, the Renaissance painter Raphael, and other great Italians are buried in the Pantheon.</p>
