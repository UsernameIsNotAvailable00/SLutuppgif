All processing of personal data must comply with the basic principles set out in the Data Protection Regulation. The Data Protection Regulation contains a number of basic principles that can be said to be the core of the regulation. The principles apply to all personal data processing and set the ultimate framework for what is a permitted processing. The law is based on 7 basic principles which means, among other things, that you as the person responsible for personal data:</p><ol><li>Must be supported by the Data Protection Regulation in order to process personal data.</li><li>May only collect personal data for specific, specifically stated and legitimate purposes.</li><li>Shall not process more personal data than is necessary for the purposes.</li><li>Shall ensure that the personal data is correct.</li><li>Shall delete the personal data when they are no longer needed.</li><li>Shall protect personal data, for example so that unauthorized persons do not have access to them and so that they are not lost or destroyed.</li><li>Should be able to show that you live up to the Data Protection Ordinance and how you do it.</li></ol><p>GDPR is for companies not to misuse people's personal data (address, telephone number, user ID, name, customer number, etc.). The purpose of this law is to protect people against the violation of their personal integrity through the processing of personal data. The Personal Data Act is intended to protect you against your personal privacy being violated when your personal data is processed, ie collected, registered, stored and used. The rules largely try to prevent data about you from being collected just because they are good to have and then saved for later use for a completely different purpose. <br> <br>If you violate the law, the Data Inspectorate can impose fines depending on how serious the violation is and depending on whether it has been intentional or not. It is also crucial what you have done about the problem, if you benefit financially from it and similar circumstances. The maximum fine is EUR 20 million, or 4% of your global turnover, whichever is higher. <br> <br>Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or trade union membership may not be stored. It is also forbidden to process personal data relating to health or sexual life. The law applies to the processing of personal data throughout society. Here we concentrate on what applies to the processing of personal data when you approve a user agreement. <br> <br>The Personal Data Act states, among other things, that personal data must be processed correctly and may only be processed for special, explicitly stated and justified purposes. The information collected must be relevant to the purpose of the treatment. The company may also not process more personal data than is necessary. <br> <br>In order for a company to process your personal data, you must first give your consent, for example by approving a user agreement. You have the right to apply for a register extract from the company once a year. There you will see if you are registered and what information is available about you. You can also see where the information is taken from, the purposes of the processing and to which recipients or categories of recipients the information is disclosed. If the information about you is incorrect, you can request that the company correct it. <br> <br>You always have the right to request that a company not use your personal information for direct marketing. There is no national register but you contact the respective company in writing. However, if you request that your information not be used for direct marketing, this may of course mean that you may not use the service. One way for you to pay for yourself is to provide information about yourself. <br> <br>However, there are also some negative factors you have to know about the Personal Data Act:</p><ol><li>Data protection lacks definitions, which makes it technologically neutral, but also more difficult to enforce.</li><li>Data protection is indiscriminate, it applies to a small business or a club in the same way as it applies to a global conglomerate.</li><li>Data networks are global, but data protection is local.</li><li>Strict Maintenance of Data – as a “data controller” you will be expected to abide by the data protection principles and properly maintain data you gather within the remit of the law. Every business is expected to do this, registered or not.</li></ol><p>This website does not collect any personal data or information, and therefore does not break the GDPR law.</p> <br> <br><h3>The Electronic Communications Act</h3><p>The Electronic Communications Act regulates radio, television, telephone and data communication. What is most relevant to you as a website creator is the regulations regarding cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is saved on your computer when you visit a website. This is often to make it easier for you in your browsing, for example so that you do not have to fill in the same information several times. <br> <br>It can also have fewer noble purposes, such as mapping your surfing and gathering information about you. They are often used to customize the advertising on the pages you visit. According to the law, everyone who visits a website with cookies must be informed that the website contains cookies and what the purpose of them is. The visitor must also give their consent. People have the right to decide how and what things on their computers are stored on their computers. It is mainly private individuals who benefit from this because they in that way can have full control over their information and what is stored. <br> <br>This shall be achieved primarily by promoting competition and international harmonization in this field. However, universal services must always be available on all equal terms throughout the country at affordable prices. When applying the law, special consideration shall be given to the importance of electronic communications for freedom of expression and freedom of information. This Act applies to electronic communications networks and communication services with associated installations and services as well as other radio use. The law does not apply to content transmitted in electronic communications networks using electronic communications services. The law created a uniform and technology-neutral legislation for all electronic communications to meet the fact that products and services in the area are becoming increasingly independent of platform. <br> <br>This website does not have any cookies and therefore does not break the laws regarding The Electronic Communications.</p> <br> <br><h3>Copyright</h3> <br><p>Copyright protects artistic creation such as music, film and literature. The protection cannot be applied for but arises automatically when the work arrives. If the work is original (unique), the author has protection, copyright, for his work. No registration or the like is required for the copyright protection to apply. A work that is covered by copyright may as a rule not be used without the author's permission. <br> <br>Copyright consists of two main parts: the non-profit part and the economic part. The non-profit copyright mainly means that the author has the right to be specified as the author when the work is performed or used. The non-profit right is always retained by the author. <br> <br>The economic right is the author's exclusive right to dispose of the work by producing copies of the work and to make the work available to the public. An author can make a work available e.g., by performing a play or film. Books and other printed material are made available through distribution to the public. Accessibility of mainly visual art takes place through public display. An author can also transfer a work via e.g. Internet. <br> <br>One of the basic ideas with copyright is that the author should receive compensation for his work. The person who writes a book can either publish it himself and sell the books individually or he transfers the rights to the book to a publisher for a fee. <br> <br>This website uses only the content that is allowed to be published by others, and therefore is legal. We even cite the original work.</p> <br><h2>Sources:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.imy.se/verksamhet/dataskydd/det-har-galler-enligt-gdpr/grundlaggande-principer/">www.imy.se</a></li><li><a href="https://www.visolit.se/artiklar/skillnader-mellan-plu-och-gdpr ">www.visolit.se</a></li><li><a href="https://internetstiftelsen.se/guide/anvandarvillkoren/personuppgiftslagen/ ">internetstiftelsen.se</a></li><li><a href="https://riksarkivet.se/upphovsratt ">riksarkivet.se</a></li><li><a href="http://ictlaw.com/data-protection/dataprotectionwhy/advantages/ ">ictlaw.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thecompanywarehouse.co.uk/blog/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-data-protection-registration ">www.thecompanywarehouse.co.uk</a></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
